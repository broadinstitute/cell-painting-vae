# Variational Autoencoder on Cell Painting Data

## Computational Environment
First install conda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

Then, to create the computational environment, run:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cell-painting-vae
```

To reproduce results, follow the instructions in each analysis module in the following order:

[0.preprocessing](/cell-painting/0.preprocessing)

[1.optimize](/cell-painting/1.optimize)

[2.train](/cell-painting/2.train)

[3.application](/cell-painting/3.application)
